# GEO AI Plugin Improvement Progress

## Completed Work
- Implemented last-run reminders in the Gutenberg sidebar, surfacing the stored `_geoai_audit_timestamp`, formatting it for display, and warning editors when results are missing or older than seven days. This fulfills the "Last-run reminders" item from the workflow efficiency theme. 【F:src/editor.js†L27-L72】【F:includes/class-geoai-rest.php†L185-L198】
- Updated quick-fix handling to refresh the editor state in place after REST responses, including success messaging and busy states, aligning with the "Inline quick fixes" workflow improvement. 【F:src/editor.js†L99-L135】【F:includes/class-geoai-rest.php†L109-L183】

## Not Yet Addressed
- Elevate trust signals by exposing citation metadata inside the audit sidebar and persisting historical scores.
- Expand Gemini analysis coverage to include schema remediation guidance and competitive landscape insights.
- Add reliability safeguards such as usage metering, rate limiting, and granular role capabilities.
- Build onboarding assets like audit exports, guided tours, and tooltips for new editors.
